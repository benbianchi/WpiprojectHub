### Nicholas Bradford, Ben Bianchi, and co.
A Django web app for WPI students and faculty to meet and collaborate on side projects, MQPs, research, startups, and anything else.

## Installation

Create a new Python 2 virtualenv, activate it, and install dependencies:

    $ virtualenv env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Install dependencies in `./static/bower.json`:

    $ cd ./static
    $ bower install
    $ cd ..

Create a superuser account for yourself:

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

Run the server at **http://localhost:8000/** to view a development version of the site:

    $ python manage.py runserver

## About

### Why this exists

As a freshman attempting to get involved with research, or a junior trying to find an MQP, students are limited to sending emails to professors in search of potential opportunities. Likewise, when faculty want to enlist students, they are limited to blasting out emails to the major aliases We have several existing systems for project posting, but they are fragmented, under-publicized, and under-utilized. This is bad, because starting early with research and side projects gives you the experience/skills needed for the best internships/jobs/MQP success.

### Our solution

Students/faculty can create account (authenticated by wpi.edu email), and can create projects with Title, Dates, Description, Skills Required, etc. Anyone can visit main page of the website to view complete list of projects, which is filterable (by skills) and searchable (by keywords).

### Our goals

* Simple: easy to maintain and easy to use, focus on just linking the right people together (offload other responsibilities to Email, Slack, Facebookâ€¦).
* Generic: We want something generic: works with formal research initiatives, MQPs, startups, and student-led collaborative projects.
* Extendable: can later expand to include cross-institution collaboration with other Worcester or Massachusetts universities, and then to everywhere else.
